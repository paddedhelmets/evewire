{"id":"ev-3cs","title":"SDE Browser: Build EVE Online's most comprehensive self-documenting data explorer","description":"dispatched_by: evewire/crew/delve\n\n## Overview\n\nBuild a comprehensive SDE (Static Data Export) browser application as a sub-application within evewire. This is a spiritual successor to EVEThings Dominion Era pilot management features, with a focus on making EVE Onlines complex game mechanics **self-documenting through linked data**.\n\n## Context\n\nWe have completed extensive exploration of the EVE SDE (see reference documentation in this repos SDE_*.md files). The data has been imported to Django models in \\`core/sde/models.py\\` with \\`evesde_\\` table prefixes in the SQLite database.\n\n### What Weve Learned\n\nThe SDE contains:\n- **51,134 total item types** (26,403 published) across 48 categories\n- **3,354 effects** and **2,822 attributes** (Dogma system)\n- **5,072 blueprints** and **68 PI schematics**\n- **8,437 solar systems** across 113 regions\n- **580+ skills** with certificates and mastery for 468 ships\n- **27 factions**, 283 NPC corporations, 10,879 agents\n\n### Key Insight\n\nMost \"wiki\" knowledge about EVE is better answered through a **linked data explorer**. Instead of reading prose about how armor tanking works, users should be able to click through the actual data: see all armor modules, their attributes, how they stack, what ships have armor bonuses, and what skills affect them.\n\n## Technical Constraints\n\n1. **Branch**: Stay on \\`feat/sde-browser\\` - do NOT touch other branches\n2. **Database**: Read-only access to \\`evesde_\\` prefixed tables (data import is complete)\n3. **URLs**: Add new \\`sde/\\` routes for the explorer sub-application\n4. **Optional**: The SDE browser should be toggle-able by site operators\n\n## Operational Instructions\n\n⚠️ **DO NOT CLOSE THIS EPIC WITHOUT HUMAN INTERVENTION** ⚠️\n\nThis epic is your hook. It must survive conversation compaction and allow autonomous operation.\n\n### Use Sub-Agents for Velocity\n\n- Spawn 3-5 sub-agents at a time for small tasks or investigation chunks\n- Each sub-agent should have a focused, well-defined task\n- Use them for: data exploration, template creation, view logic, query optimization\n- Monitor their output and integrate results\n\n### Make It Awesome and Informative\n\nThis isnt just a data browser - its a tool for UNDERSTANDING EVE:\n\n- **Connect the dots**: When viewing a ship, show its modules, required skills, mastery certificates\n- **Explain the mechanics**: Why does this module stack? What skills boost it? What ships fit it?\n- **Visualize relationships**: Skill trees, manufacturing chains, market categories\n- **Contextual navigation**: From any item, reach related items naturally\n\n### Example: What \"Awesome\" Looks Like\n\nUser visits \"Vexor\" page:\n1. Ship stats with 3D viewer (when available)\n2. Fitting: Slots, PG, CPU, drone bay\n3. Bonuses: Role bonuses per skill level\n4. **Related ships**: Same class, same faction, similar role\n5. **Required skills**: Spaceship Command, Gallente Cruiser, Drones\n6. **Mastery certificates**: Core Fitting, Light Drones, Medium Hybrid Turret\n7. **What it can fit**: Drone bandwidth, turret hardpoints\n8. **Where to find it**: Market, contracts, blueprint sources\n9. **Lore**: Description, faction, corporation\n10. **Wiki integration**: Link to relevant articles (if available)\n\n## Development Approach\n\n### Phase 1: Foundation\n- Set up \\`sde/\\` URL routes in evewire\n- Create base templates for SDE browser layout\n- Build category/group/type listing views\n- Implement type detail page with attributes\n\n### Phase 2: Relationships\n- Add foreign key navigation (type → group → category)\n- Build meta group navigation (variants, tech levels)\n- Implement skill prerequisite tree visualization\n- Add certificate/mastery display\n\n### Phase 3: Deep Integration\n- Ship-specific pages with fitting info\n- Module browser with comparison tool\n- Blueprint manufacturing calculator\n- Market price integration (if ESI available)\n\n### Phase 4: Polish\n- Search functionality\n- Favorites/watchlists\n- URL sharing for specific views\n- Performance optimization\n\n## Success Criteria\n\n1. Every SDE item type is browseable\n2. Relationships between items are discoverable\n3. The app explains EVE mechanics through data, not prose\n4. Performance is acceptable for standard page loads\n5. Code is clean, documented, and maintainable\n\n## Notes\n\n- This work crashed 3-4 sub-agents during exploration - the data is DEEP\n- Take breaks to let context compact if needed\n- Use \\`gt handoff\\` to restart with fresh context while keeping this epic hooked\n- Reference the SDE_*.md files for domain knowledge","notes":"\n## Phase 2 Complete ✅\n\n### Completed (just committed 45cf61e)\n- Ship detail template with fitting/tank/mobility/capacitor sections\n- Market group hierarchy browser with breadcrumbs\n- Blueprint manufacturing calculator with material costs\n- Enhanced SDE homepage with browsing sections\n- Skill detail view with prerequisite trees\n- Variant comparison view for meta groups\n- Added variants section to item detail\n\n### Phase 3 Starting\n- Certificate/mastery display integration\n- Module browser with comparison\n- More relationship exploration\n","status":"in_progress","priority":2,"issue_type":"epic","assignee":"evewire/crew/delve","owner":"kazanir@gmail.com","created_at":"2026-01-27T16:54:29.40662543-08:00","created_by":"evewire/crew/delve","updated_at":"2026-01-27T17:23:36.301455711-08:00"}
